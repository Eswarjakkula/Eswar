# Social Media Scheduler

A simple web-based social media scheduler using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project provides a basic interface for scheduling social media posts. Users can enter their post content and select a date and time for the post to be scheduled. Scheduled posts are displayed on the page and stored in the browser's local storage.

**Features:**

* Enter post content.
* Select a date and time for scheduling.
* Display scheduled posts.
* Stores scheduled posts in local storage.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Enter your post content in the text area.

5.  Click the "Schedule Post" button.
6.  Scheduled posts will appear below.

## Technologies Used

## Local Storage

This application utilizes local storage to persist scheduled posts. This means that posts will be saved even after the browser is closed.

## Future Enhancements

* Add editing and deleting functionality for scheduled posts.
* Improve the user interface and user experience.
* Add Time zone support.
